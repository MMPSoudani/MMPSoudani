Greetings, I'm @MMPSudani

View my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-sudani-9b8128196/">linkedIn profile</a> to get to know me better.

But to have a short description about me:

I am in love with software engineering, software development, and programming in general. I love and enjoy every step of this journey, from writing the SRS and FRS documents, to designing the conceptual and logical database models, and all the way to realizing the software by programming it. Every step, every challenge, every failure, every success...
 
As an organized person with a high sense of responsibility, I enjoy the challenges of working in a professional environment, that has healthy social interactions and coordination, where management is based on teamwork.

The knowledge and skills I have acquired in the different working environments have shaped my ability to adapt quickly, work productively, think creatively, and work effectively as part of a team or individually.
